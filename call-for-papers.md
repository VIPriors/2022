We solicit submissions that in the broad sense focus on achieving data efficiency through incorporating prior knowledge of the visual domain into network design. This includes the following topics:

- Pre-wired invariance/equivariance to symmetries, such as translation, rotation, scaling, etc.
- Parameter sharing for data efficiency
- (Meta-)learning symmetries from data
- Unsupervised learning through visual priors, e.g. contrastive learning
- Color invariants/constants in Deep Learning
- Data augmentation
- Human vision as an inspiration for data-efficient vision algorithms, e.g. reducing texture bias in Convolutional Neural Networks, modeling network operations after human vision, etc.
- Alternative data-efficient operators for Deep Learning inspired by visual inductive priors, e.g. alternative compact filter bases, Capsule Networks, etc.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive! We strongly encourage novel approaches to data efficient methods using visual prior knowledge.

## Submissions

Submissions are sollicited through OpenReview. Reviewing will be double-blind. We do not have a discussion/rebuttal period. The top accepted papers will be invited to orally present their work during the workshop.

Accepted papers will be published in ECCV 2022 Workshop proceedings. Submissions must follow [the ECCV 2022 submission format](https://eccv2022.ecva.net/submission/). Optional supplementary material can be submitted through OpenReview (single .zip file, maximum of 50MB). The deadline for supplementary material is the same as the paper submission deadline.

**Timeline**

- (ECCV paper notifications: July 3rd, 2022)
- Submission deadline: July 3rd, 2022, 23:59 GMT
  - _After ECCV paper notifications. Exact time may be delayed. See details below._
- Author notifications: July 10th, 2022
- Camera-ready deadline: July 17th, 2022, 23:59 GMT

Please note that this year's timeline is quite tight. This is due to workshops being required to match the camera-ready deadline of the ECCV conference, while we would still like to offer the opportunity for rejected ECCV submissions to be submitted to our workshop. As such, we will ensure that our submission deadline will be after the ECCV decisions are out. We will communicate any changes to the deadlines on this website and through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/VIPriorsECCV).

## Call for posters

Authors of recent and relevant works (including works accepted at the main ECCV 2022 conference paper track) are invited to present a **poster** of their work at our workshop. Please apply by sending an email to [vipriors-ewi@tudelft.nl](mailto:vipriors-ewi@tudelft.nl) before **August 22nd, 2022**.
